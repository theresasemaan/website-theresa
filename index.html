    A ceremonial auction house dedicated to creatures that exist only in ink, myth, and memory.

  <p>
    Each lot is a fragment salvaged from monasteries, private collections, and vanished libraries.

  <h3>Curated Lots</h3>
  <p>
    Ownership is symbolic. What is acquired is the right to safeguard a story.

  <h3>Imaginary Creatures & Medieval Thought</h3>

  <p class="focus">
    In medieval Europe, imaginary creatures were not fantasies —
    they were symbols, warnings, and lessons encoded in visual form.
  </p>

  <p>
    Bestiaries combined theology, folklore, and observation.
    Creatures at the edges of the known world embodied fear of the unknown,
    moral conflict, and humanity’s attempt to explain what could not be proven.
  </p>

  <p>
    This Archive revisits that tradition.
    Each creature exists not as proof, but as a question —
    preserved as ink, interpretation, and memory.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="Box">
  <h3>How the Archive Is Read</h3>

  <p class="focus">
    The Archive is not meant to be consumed quickly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each image, description, and fragment is presented without final explanation.
    As in medieval manuscripts, meaning is layered, partial, and sometimes contradictory.
  </p>

  <p>
    Visitors are encouraged to read slowly, observe margins,
    and accept uncertainty as part of the record.

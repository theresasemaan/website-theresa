  <h2>The Nature of the Auction</h2>

  <p class="highlight">
    These auctions do not trade objects alone — they trade custodianship.
  </p>

  <p>
    Each lot presented in the Archive is derived from a fragment, illustration,
    or textual reference whose origin is incomplete, disputed, or symbolic.
    The act of bidding is not ownership, but agreement to preserve the narrative
    attached to the piece.
  </p>

  <p>
    Successful bidders receive documentation, reproduction rights,
    and a formal record of custodianship within the Archive.
    No claim of historical authenticity is implied.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="Box">
  <h3>Conditions of Participation</h3>

  <p class="focus">
    Bidding is ceremonial and time-bound.
  </p>

  <p>
    All auctions close at predetermined hours.
    Once concluded, a lot is withdrawn and may never reappear
    in the same form.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Archive reserves the right to withhold fragments
    whose symbolic weight exceeds scholarly clarity.

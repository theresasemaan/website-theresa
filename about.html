    <h2>The Purpose of the Archive</h2>
    <p class="highlight">
      The Archive of Imaginary Creatures is a fictional institution dedicated to
      manuscripts that document beings never confirmed to exist — yet never forgotten.
    </p>
    <p>
      Compiled from medieval bestiaries, speculative atlases, and marginal annotations,
      the archive preserves fragments of worlds imagined by monks, scholars, and unknown hands.

    <h3>Imaginary Creatures & Medieval Thought</h3>
    <p class="focus">
      In medieval Europe, imaginary creatures were not fantasies — they were symbols,
      warnings, and lessons encoded in visual form.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dragons represented chaos and temptation, hybrid beasts illustrated moral conflict,
      and distant lands were populated by creatures marking the edge of the known world.

    <h3>The Auction Concept</h3>
    <p>
      The Archive operates as a conceptual auction house. Each lot represents not ownership
      of an object, but stewardship of a narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Collectors acquire fragments of forgotten myth — preserved, catalogued,
      and passed forward as cultural memory.
    </p>
  </div>

  <h2>About the Archive</h2>

  <p class="highlight">
    The Archive of Imaginary Creatures is not a museum, nor a marketplace in the modern sense.
  </p>

  <p>
    It is a curated collection inspired by medieval bestiaries, lost atlases, and
    marginal illustrations where fact, belief, and imagination once coexisted.
    In these manuscripts, creatures were not invented for entertainment —
    they were symbols, warnings, and mirrors of the human condition.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our work draws from this tradition. Each entry, reproduction, and catalogue
    fragment is designed to echo the visual language of medieval scribes:
    imperfect, symbolic, and intentionally incomplete.
  </p>

  <p>
    The Archive does not claim authenticity of origin.
    What it preserves is atmosphere, narrative, and the fragile boundary
    between knowledge and myth.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="Box">
  <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>

  <p class="focus">
    To collect is to remember. To reproduce is to protect.
  </p>

  <p>
    In an age of instant images and endless replication, the Archive slows the act of looking.
    Each piece invites study rather than consumption, contemplation rather than certainty.
  </p>

  <p>
    The creatures remain unnamed when their names are lost.
    The maps remain unfinished where history failed to agree.
